# Github action for bundle taro react native project

Use this action to package your [Taro React Native](https://docs.taro.zone/) project and generate bundles for Android and iOS. Others can use [Taro Playground APP](https://github.com/wuba/taro-playground) to load the bundle for project preview.

Make it easier to share your ideas.

**Note:** Your React Native version and dependencies must be compatible with the [Taro Playground APP](https://github.com/wuba/taro-playground/blob/main/package.json). 
## Workflow

1. Execute `yarn build:rn` to build the bundle.
2. Generate a [Taro Playground APP](https://github.com/wuba/taro-playground) protocol, including platform, name, logo and bundle url.
3. Export the protocol to a file with a QR code.
4. Commit the changes.
5. If `GITHUB_REF_NAME` is tag
   1. Delete the original tag and re-tag it.
   2. Generate a release, including the QR code and other information.
6. If `GITHUB_REF_NAME` is branch
   1. Push the changes to the branch.
